Property Subject to Restriction. The real property subject to this Restriction is legally
decribed in Exhibit A, attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. Reference herein to a “Unit”
or “Units”, shall mean and refer to the inclusionary dwelling units shown on Exhibit B, which are
improvements located on the real property described in Exhibit A. This Restriction shall be binding upon
Developer, and its successors and assigns, and shall be deemed to run with each Unit, as a benefit and a
burden for the entire term of this Restriction, unless released or terminated earlier as provided herein.
3. Income Restriction on Sales. Subject to Section 5, each Initial Sale of the
Units shall be made only to an Owner having an annual income of up to eighty percent (80%) of Area
Median Income and Subject to Section 5, each Initial Sale of the Units shall be made only to an
Owner having an annual income of up to seventy percent (70%) of Area Median Income. Seller shall be
required to document the income eligibility of the Owner. The method for calculation of income
eligibility will involve the use of gross income from the previous tax year or the projected income for the
current tax year based upon current earnings. Documentation shall be collected that includes a copy of
the filed income tax forms from the previous year, or three current wage receipts.
4. Initial Sales Price. The sales price of a Unit at the time of an Initial Sale shall be
calculated based on a monthly payment that includes property taxes, homeowner’s insurance, private
mortgage insurance, condominium association fees (if applicable) and the payment of principal and
interest on a fixed rate thirty (30) year mortgage. The monthly payment shall not exceed thirty percent
(30%) of the monthly income for the applicable AMI, based on an Owner’s family size and the number of
bedrooms per Unit being sold. At the option of the Seller, the sales price for each Unit may be set at the
start of the marketing period for the Unit, rather than at the time a building permit is issued. The
applicable interest rate for establishing the initial sales price shall be that interest rate which is determined
quarterly by the City of Madison, Department of Planning and Development, that is available as of the
date on which the building permit for the dwelling unit to be constructed is issued or the commencement
of the marketing period, based on the choice of the Seller. With the exception of a refrigerator and stove,
major appliances for the dwelling unit in question, and landscaping of the Unit, shall be considered as
optional amenities. If an Owner of a Unit wishes to finance these optional amenities as part of the home
mortgage, their cost should not be considered part of the purchase price of the Unit.
5. Failure to Sell. If an acceptable offer to purchase for any Unit has not been received by
the Seller after an 80% Unit has been marketed for one hundred twenty (120) days, the Seller may market
the Unit to a family with an AMI that is at or below 90% of AMI and for a 70% Unit which has been
marketed for one hundred twenty (120) days, the Seller may market the Unit to a family with an AMI that
is at or below 80% of AMI. For each additional one hundred twenty (120) day period without a sale, the
Seller may market a Unit to a family with an AMI that is at or below an additional ten percent (10%) of
2
AMI. If the Seller has provided notice of the marketing period to the City as provided in Section 6, and if
a Unit remains unsold after 240 days, the Seller may sell the Unit at market rate.
